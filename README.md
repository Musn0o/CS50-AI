# 🎓 CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my personal progress and solutions for [CS50's AI course by Harvard University](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/). The course provides an excellent foundation in core AI concepts using Python, including search, knowledge representation, probabilistic inference, machine learning, and neural networks.
